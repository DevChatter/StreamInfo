# Tuesday, April 17, 2018 Stream - New ASP.NET Core and Vue.js Project

Planned to start at 12:00 PM EDT (4:00 PM UTC).

## New GameTracker Project

We're starting a new project using ASP.NET Core and Vue.js as a simple side-project to work on in addition to the Chat Bot. For this project we'll be creating a program to record game stats, keeping track of games, players, winners, teachers, etc. eventually using this to pull interesting stats and reports as well.
