# DevChatter Guests Introduction

Thanks so much for your interest in being a guest on DevChatter! The DevChatter community is all looking forward to having you on the stream!

## Before the Stream

There are a few things that need to happen before the stream.

### Establish the Date

Check the [upcoming streams](https://github.com/DevChatter/StreamInfo#upcoming-streams), and chat with me to choose a date of the stream.

My regular schedule is:

- Monday 2PM Eastern Time
- Tuesday 2PM Eastern Time
- Thursday 12PM Eastern Time
- Saturday 1PM Eastern Time

### Select a Topic

If you've got a particular area of expertise that you wish to highlight, we can find a way to work that into the stream. We currently have a few types of streams that we do:

- DevChatter Coding Projects
  - [DevChatterBot](https://github.com/DevChatter/devchatterbot) - Twitch Chat Bot, ASP.NET Core and C#
  - [Rock Paper Scissors Boom](https://github.com/DevChatter/RockPaperScissorsBoom) - Developer Competition using Rock-Paper-Scissors
  - [GameTracker](https://github.com/DevChatter/GameTracker) - Web App to track games played, ASP.NET Core and C#
  - [DevChatter.com](https://github.com/DevChatter/devchatter.com) - Static site using wyam.io and hosted on Azure Static Site
- Programming Exercises
  - [Ardalis Kata Catalog](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog)
- [Learn to Code in C#](https://www.twitch.tv/events/9I5Zdxl4Q_eTUV_QjHxxQg)

We'll want to choose a topic that we can work on together, but keep in mind that some topics are on specific days. For example, the "Learn to Code in C#" streams are scheduled in advance.

### Before Stream Preparations

Before the stream, you can look up the project we'll be working on at our GitHub. You can check our video archives to see how the stream usually works. 

If you're not sure about your computer's audio/video set up, we can set up a quick skype call in advance to check everything.

Also, be sure to arrive to the event 15 minutes before hand, so we can work through all the technical issues and chat in advance of the stream.
